3. Press the deploy button and everything should be functioning properly. 

4. See the below instructions if you want ot customize the alerts to your liking

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CUSTOMIZING CODE:

1. Go to the Functions/src/main/java/functions folder and you'll see a "OpsGenie" and "AlertType" file

ENABLE/DISABLE ALERT TYPE

-If you want to simply enable/disable certain alert types only open the "OpsGenie" file and go down to the section with the comment above it saying "ALERT PATHS". Each section has very clear function names that describe what alert it is creating. Just edit the if/else statement to not include a ceratin alert type you don't want. 

CUSTOMIZING ALERT DETAILS
-IF you would like to customize the details of a specific alert, go to the "AlertType" file and look at the function corresponding to the event trigger you would like to change. There are some comments in each section to help generally guide you but depending on what you need please view the following:

    -To add more OpsGenie specific details, please view the OpsGenie Java API for the function calls that are available in addition to the comments in the "newInsight" function which give you examples of additional fields you can populate if you so choose. 

    -To access specific details of an EventBridge event, go to the Eventbridge https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/events/home?region=us-east-1#/explore and go down to "Sample Event". Choose the event type such as "devops guru new insight open" to see the json format and the details available for you to access. From there, follow the existing examples using the jsonNode variable "input" to grab the information you desire for your alert. 

AFTER YOU CUSTOMIZE YOUR CODE

-Run a "Maven build" in your IDE such as Eclipse to make a new .jar file out of your code and upload it to your Lambda function
